## Environment set-up

### Operating system

[UNIX-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems are ideal for web development due to their compatibility with production environments, powerful command-line tools, robust package management, and support for open-source technologies. They provide a stable, secure, and efficient platform with tools and workflows designed to replicate and manage modern web development stacks seamlessly.

MacOS users have a UNIX-like system out of the box. Windows users have three options to get started with a Linux system:

- **Dual-boot**: the best way to get started with Linux. It allows you to keep your current OS and switch between it and Linux at boot time. It is also the only way to get the best performance out of your hardware.
- **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux): a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019. It is a good way to get started with Linux without having to dual-boot. Note: You'll need to learn how to use WSL as it is not as straightforward as using a Linux distro natively.
- **Virtual machine**: a good way to get started with Linux without having to dual-boot. It is slower than dual-booting and requires more resources.

Before going with a VM or a dual-boot, you have to pick up a [Linux distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) to work with. Some are more beginner-friendly than others:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), easy (recommended)
- [Pop_OS](https://pop.system76.com/), easy
- [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), medium
- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), hard
- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), hard

> **Note**: Teacher will use Arch Linux with GNOME desktop environment.

### Code editor

You can use any code editor you like, but some are more beginner-friendly than others:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), easy (recommended)
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/), easy
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)/[Neovim](https://neovim.io/), hard

It is also recommended to install a lightweigth text editor for quick edits (like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)).

> **Note**: Teacher will use Visual Studio Code.

### Browser

You can use any browser you like. It is recommended to have at least two browsers installed to test your code on different engines:

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

> **Note**: Teacher will use Firefox.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular version control system. It is recommended to use the command line to learn it properly. Don't forget to configure your username and email.

### Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is needed to run JavaScript code outside of the browser: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

To install Node.js, it is recommended to use a version manager as it allows you to switch between different versions of Node.js:

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [n](https://github.com/tj/n)
- [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

> **Note**: Teacher will use n.

#### Package manager

NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. It is installed along with Node.js.

Some alternatives to NPM are [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

> **Note**: Teacher will use pnpm.

### Password manager

A password manager is a software application that is used to store and manage the passwords that a user has for various online accounts and security features. Password managers store the passwords in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the password information with the help of a master password. They help to protect against phishing attacks and password reuse.

Popular open source solutions are:

- [Buttercup](https://buttercup.pw/)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
